        "This project is aimed at translating highly undrsampled MRF to a clinically feasible tool, by building a robust reconstruction pipeline that is portable between different compute systems (research lab, hospital, high performance computing cluster, collaborators, etc...). To achieve this these core objectives were set:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The pipeline should run smoothly on multiple systems.\n",
        "- The pipeline should be easy to upgrade when the sequence, the reconstruction method, or the synthesis method is changed.\n",
        "- The pipeline should be able to provide an image to send back to the scanner within 5 min.\n",
        "- The pipeline should be able to send a series of images to PACS within ~30min.\n",
        "- The pipeline should run on hardware available in clinical settings (for now, this means an 11GB GPU).\n",
        "\n",
        "This modular MRF processing pipeline includes 4 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Download demo data and code \n",
        "2.   Reconstruct and get coil compression from calibration scan\n",
        "3.   Reconstruct MRF (fast subspace basis reconstruction)\n",
        "4.   Synthesize clinical contrasts\n",
        "\n",
        "Each step will be demonstrated here, and documentation on how to run the equivalent Docker/Singularity containers on your own machine will be explained in a final section of this document.\n"
